## Tech Stack

- HTML
- SCSS

  - [Lightcase.js](https://cornel.bopp-art.com/lightcase/)



## Description

This website uses CSS Flexbox to layout a series of photos. Clicking on a photo enlarges it using Lightcase.js. I also implemented a search bar that searches the description attached to each photo.
